"""Resource detection and transparent hardware recommendations (R01).

The toolkit is a product for many different machines, so no part of it may
assume a particular GPU, two GPUs, 64 GB RAM or a personal model directory.
This module answers two questions:

* **What is there?** :func:`detect_resources` returns a plain data object with
  CPU cores, RAM and the visible compute devices (stable identifier, name,
  backend, free/total VRAM).  A value that could not be determined is ``None``,
  never ``0`` - "unknown" and "nothing" are different answers.
* **What does that mean?** :func:`recommend_profiles` turns a snapshot into
  labelled recommendations with a reason and an explicit confidence, so the UI
  can show the automatic suggestion next to the setting the user actually
  chose.  Recommendations are starting points, never silent overrides.

Design constraints kept deliberately:

* importing this module never imports ``torch`` - CPU-only installations work;
* no OOM probe loading, no network, no download, no writes;
* several GPUs are **not** one contiguous memory pool; budgets are per device;
* a low-RAM machine is never told to "just offload more to CPU".

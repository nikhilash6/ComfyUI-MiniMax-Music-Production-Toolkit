"""Central UI help/tooltip support for the custom-node package.

ComfyUI displays the ``tooltip`` option from INPUT_TYPES when the user hovers
an input label/widget.  Keeping the help text in one file makes it possible to
add detailed help to every input without duplicating processing code.

Resolution order for every input (first hit wins):

1. the node's own inline ``tooltip`` written next to the field declaration -
   the most local and usually the most specific text;
2. :data:`NODE_INPUT_TOOLTIPS` for that node, exact name first, then ``re:``
   pattern keys;
3. :data:`GENERIC_INPUT_TOOLTIPS`, for fields with the same meaning everywhere;
4. :data:`GENERIC_PATTERN_TOOLTIPS`, for indexed families such as
   ``candidate_3``;
5. :func:`_fallback_tooltip`, which exists only so no input is ever left
   without help - ``tests/test_node_documentation.py`` fails as soon as an input
   would need it.

In the supplied workflow this is linked directly to MiniMax Square Image Size, so a 1024x1024 JPG also embeds as 1024x1024. Larger embedded art increases audio-file size and some older players may prefer 512 or 1024.",

    "size_preset": "Square artwork resolution preset (256 up to 3096). Larger images cost more VRAM/time. Choose custom to use custom_size instead of a fixed preset. Note: the FLUX.2 latent stage quantizes to multiples of 16, so 3096 is effectively rendered as 3088 - prefer 3072x3072 for an exact size.",

    "year": "Release/copyright year tag. Use a four-digit year when possible for broad player compatibility.",

Bypass performs no analysis or repair.",

Lower values replace a wider portion around each clipped crest and can smooth harsher clipping, but values that are too low may reshape legitimate loud transients. Used exactly in Custom/Analyze only; presets show their effective value.",

Very small values detect genuinely flat hard-clipping plateaus and avoid mistaking naturally rounded sine/bass peaks for clipping. Larger values also catch slightly processed/rounded clipping but raise false-positive risk.",

Auto uses 3 samples to avoid reshaping ordinary smooth peaks; Standard can detect shorter two-sample flat tops. A value of 1 is extremely aggressive because any above-threshold peak can qualify.",
        "slope_context_samples": "Number of clean samples outside each clipped region used to estimate entry and exit slopes for the cubic-Hermite reconstruction. More context smooths the estimate and helps low-frequency peaks; too much context can ignore a very fast transient's local shape.",

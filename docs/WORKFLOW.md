# Complete workflow guide

**Version 3.0:** Open [Music_Production_Toolkit.json](../example_workflows/Music_Production_Toolkit.json) for YuE2, YuE2 Cover or MiniMax. CHOOSE controls the song mode, artwork, refinement and mastering; SOURCE AUDIO supplies a cover track. See [the song and cover guide](YUE2.md). The classic MiniMax workflow below retains its existing processing chain.

The included workflow is designed as an end-to-end MiniMax Music 3 production example. You can remove stages you do not need, but this document describes the complete graph.

## 1. Prompt preparation

`Structured Song Prompt` provides two independent prompt sources:

- the **user prompt** assembled from structured fields (Genre, Tempo, Time signature, Key, Lyrics, Language, Voice, Lyrics theme, Target length) plus a further-description area;
- the **system prompt** describing how the LLM must transform that request for MiniMax Music 3.

Each can come from:

- manual text;
- the bundled prompt library;
- an external directory.

Prompt files can start with an optional metadata block that prefills the structured fields when the file is selected (see [PROMPT_LIBRARY.md](PROMPT_LIBRARY.md)). Every field can be overridden; `custom` leaves that part out of the LLM prompt.

The bundled production system prompt requires the LLM to return:

```text
[Caption]
[Lyrics]
[Title]
[Image_Prompt]
```

The parser is intentionally order-tolerant for resilience, but the system prompt asks for this exact order.

## 2. LLM — ComfyUI, local app or cloud

The example defaults to a GGUF inside ComfyUI. The same LLM node also supports
local API servers and cloud providers. Select its mode; only relevant settings
are shown. See [LLM_PROVIDERS.md](LLM_PROVIDERS.md) for app addresses, model
selection and API key setup. No external LLM custom node is required.

The bundled example uses the user-tested local-LLM settings:

```text
max_tokens = 24576
n_ctx      = 37376
```

This is intentionally generous because the model may need to produce a detailed Caption, long instrumental section structure, lyrics, title and cover prompt in one response, and thinking is generated inside the same context. If your selected GGUF model or hardware needs less context, reduce these values together rather than assuming the example settings are universal.

The three LLM calls in this workflow - the song request and the two Cover Studio
calls - take their settings from **LLM settings · central** and receive them on
`llm_config_json`. Its values win field by field over the chat node's own
widgets, so the calls cannot drift apart; per-call settings (`enabled`, the
prompt texts, `reset_session`) stay on the chat nodes, and the connection is
optional. The **Model** dropdown on that node also lists the GGUF candidates the
toolkit verified (repository, commit, size) even before they are on disk; the
first run with a selected model downloads it into `ComfyUI/models/llm/` while
`auto_download` is on. See [LLM_PROVIDERS.md](LLM_PROVIDERS.md).

The LLM reruns on every queued execution through ComfyUI's `IS_CHANGED` hook,
even with unchanged prompts. The session-ID helper and input are no longer
needed. Cloud mode can therefore incur a new API charge on each run.
`Unload LLM (integrated)` releases toolkit-owned model memory after the chat;
it does not unload models in another local app.

### Switching the LLM section off

- Set `LLM Chat (llama.cpp) → enabled` to false (or bypass the LLM nodes).
- Fill `manual_caption` and `manual_lyrics` (optionally `manual_title`, `manual_image_prompt`) on the parser node.
- The parser falls back to these manual values; the rest of the workflow keeps running.

## 3. Structured output parser

`Parse Structured LLM Output` extracts:

- Caption
- Lyrics / instrumental section map
- Title
- Image Prompt

Its LLM input is optional; without it, the manual fallback fields are used. It also generates/provides per-song source/provenance information and the primary generation seed used downstream.

## 4. MiniMax generation settings

`MiniMax Music 3 Generation Settings` derives the text/sampler values used by the MiniMax Music 3 subgraph. The public example keeps the established defaults unless you deliberately change them.

The generated Caption and Lyrics are sent into the MiniMax Music 3 node/subgraph.

## 5. Original source archive

The MiniMax output can be saved as the original FLAC before restoration/upscaling
for later comparison or re-processing. The saver's configured peak handling and
file encoding still apply, so this is not a guaranteed bit-exact archive.

The bundled workflow does **not** write its own JSON sidecar at this stage.

## 6. Source de-clipping

`Audio Declip / Overload Repair` runs before FlashSR. It looks for hard-clipped flat-top peaks and can reconstruct plausible curvature conservatively.

This is not a limiter and cannot restore information that clipping destroyed exactly.

## 7. PRE low-pass + FlashSR (integrated)

`Audio Super Resolution (FlashSR, integrated)` replaces the previously used external Egregora node with the same processing behavior (48 kHz inference, 5.12 s chunks, 0.50 s overlap, Hann overlap-add). Its inference code is bundled with the toolkit (`flashsr_inference/`); only the FlashSR weights are checked/downloaded automatically on first use (see [../INSTALLATION.md](../INSTALLATION.md)).

The explicit PRE low-pass can remove problematic source treble before FlashSR. FlashSR then reconstructs bandwidth at a higher sample rate. Since 2.0.0 the PRE/POST low-pass values live directly on the two low-pass nodes (the former shared "FlashSR / Lowpass Settings" node was removed from the example workflow).

The full workflow intentionally preserves an original branch as well so you are not forced to replace the whole source with generated high-frequency content.

## 8. Hybrid crossover

`FlashSR Hybrid Crossover` combines the clean resampled original with controlled FlashSR high-frequency content.

The bundled workflows start in `FlashSR only` mode. Select `Original + FlashSR air`
to retain the original low band and add a controlled amount of reconstructed
high-frequency content. This stage executes only when refinement is active in
the main YuE2/MM3 workflow.

## 9. HF cymbal / shimmer repair

This stage targets sustained high-frequency smear while preserving attacks. Use conservative presets for unattended batches.

## 10. POST low-pass

The POST filter can remove excessive extreme reconstructed treble. Treat it as cleanup, not as a substitute for good hybrid settings.

## 11. EQ, sample rate and final mastering

`Audio Release Prep` performs high-quality sample-rate conversion, integrated loudness/true-peak measurement and optional static gain.

Important: it applies **one constant gain to the entire program** and caps that gain when the true-peak target would be exceeded. There is no compressor, AGC or time-varying loudness normalization in this node.

In release 2.5, this node is set to **Resample only**, default 44.1 kHz (48 kHz selectable). Before it, Auto-EQ is enabled by default and feeds its own application EQ; a separate manual 8-band EQ stays editable. After conversion, the mastering compressor targets -14 LUFS / -1 dBTP. Compression, Auto-EQ and manual EQ have independent controls. There is no second static-gain stage. See [the mastering workflow guide](WORKFLOW_OPTIMIZED.md).

## 12. FLUX.2 album artwork

The LLM-generated `[Image_Prompt]` drives the FLUX.2 Klein branch. The square-size node controls both generated JPG dimensions and the embedded cover size used by the audio savers.

In v1.0.5 the cover saver also receives the generated `title` and the same `audio_tags_json` used by the audio savers. With the default `filename_mode = album - title`, the JPG therefore receives the exact same basename as the FLAC, MP3 and production JSON. The prompt-source filename is still useful internally for provenance/output-prefix routing, but it no longer becomes the public cover filename in the bundled workflow.

See [ARTWORK_WORKFLOW.md](ARTWORK_WORKFLOW.md).

## 13. Standard audio metadata

`Standard MP3 / FLAC Metadata` provides:

- Title (generated and connected)
- Artist
- Album
- Year
- Track
- Genre
- Comment
- Album Artist
- Composer

The default filesystem naming mode is:

```text
Album - Title.ext
```

The embedded `TITLE` tag itself remains only the song title.

## 14. Central output paths

`MiniMax Output Paths` controls all output subdirectories from one place:

```text
base_output
original_subdir
sr_flac_subdir
sr_mp3_subdir
artwork_subdir
configuration_subdir
```

v1.0.4 adds:

```text
configuration_subdir = log/
```

The node emits a dedicated `configuration_prefix` for the final JSON writer.

## 15. One final production JSON

v1.0.4 changes the reproducibility-file strategy.

Older workflow versions could produce repeated JSON sidecars beside multiple audio encodings. The current workflow instead uses:

`Save Production JSON`

It depends on:

- the original FLAC saver's `save_info_json`;
- the release FLAC saver's `save_info_json`;
- the release MP3 saver's `save_info_json`;
- the saved cover JPG path;
- standard audio tags;
- the centralized `configuration_prefix`.

Since 2.0.0 the separate "Reproducible Song Metadata" node is no longer part of the example workflow: `metadata_json` is an optional input, and the canonical JSON still records the standard tags, the title and the complete `outputs` section without it.

Because those save-info/path inputs only become available after each file is saved, the final configuration writer naturally executes after the output artifacts it documents.

Default output:

```text
log/Example Album - Song Title.json
```

The canonical JSON contains both **generation configuration** and an `outputs` section describing the files that were actually written.

## 16. Legacy per-audio sidecars

`Save Audio Smart Prefix` still supports its historical `write_json_sidecar` option for backward compatibility. In the current example workflow it is OFF and the `metadata_json` input is intentionally not connected to the audio savers.

For new workflows, the centralized JSON design is recommended.

## 17. Batch generation

For batches, use the parser's song count/seed mode and prompt-library entries.
The LLM reruns on every queued execution without a session-ID input. Multiple
parser variants share one LLM response but receive different music seeds;
queue a fresh LLM execution for new lyrics or a new prompt. Across runs you can vary:

- composition;
- arrangement;
- title;
- lyrics;
- artwork concept;
- generation seed.

The output-path and JSON structure keeps the resulting assets associated without duplicating configuration records.

## YuE2 and model selection

The main `example_workflows/Music_Production_Toolkit.json` offers YuE2,
YuE2 Cover and MiniMax Music 3 through CHOOSE. New YuE2 songs generate ABC;
cover songs use source ABC from SheetSage2. YuE2's approximate Length guides
Style/Lyrics and a natural ending, without lowering the configured maximum
or cropping at the target. See [YUE2.md](YUE2.md) for setup and verification.
The numbered guide above describes the classic MiniMax workflow.

## Audio covers with YuE2

The main `Music_Production_Toolkit.json` now also offers **YuE2 Cover** in CHOOSE. Select/upload audio in SOURCE AUDIO and describe the new arrangement in WRITE. SheetSage2 supplies the score, and the source filename plus `-cover` supplies the title throughout the output pipeline. The artwork switch remains independent. See [cover instructions and model setup](YUE2.md#cover-an-audio-file).

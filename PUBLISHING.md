# Maintainer publishing guide

## Release checklist

Documentation history is kept in [combined 1.0.x notes](RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.x.md),
[combined 2.x notes](RELEASE_NOTES_v2.x.md) and individual notes from 3.0.0 onward.
Historical defaults describe those releases, not current workflow behavior.
For documentation changes after a release is tagged, keep the published tag,
assets and checksums intact; include updated documentation in the next release.

Before every release:

1. Update `VERSION`.
2. Update `[project].version` in `pyproject.toml`.
3. Update `project_info.py`.
4. Update `CITATION.cff`.
5. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
6. Add `RELEASE_NOTES_vX.Y.Z.md`.
7. Make sure the example workflow contains the intended public/generic metadata and matching workflow version.
8. Run validation/tests.
9. Build release assets.
10. Commit/push.
11. Create the matching GitHub Release/tag.
12. Let the GitHub Action publish the same immutable version to the Comfy Registry.

## Validation

From the repository root:

```bash
python scripts/validate_release.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The release validator checks required files, Python syntax, requirements-file installability (it hands every `requirements*.txt` to pip's own parser, so a file `pip install -r` would refuse fails the gate instead of the CI install step), version consistency, publisher metadata, example-workflow links including subgraph boundary links, prompt-library integrity, privacy/placeholders, node documentation and GitHub Pages demo catalog integrity.

## Build release assets

```bash
python scripts/package_release.py --output-dir dist/v3.1.2
```

This runs validation/tests first and creates:

```text
ComfyUI-MiniMax-Music-Production-Toolkit-vX.Y.Z.zip
Music_Production_Toolkit_vX.Y.Z.json
Music_Production_AudioEnhance_vX.Y.Z.json
SHA256SUMS.txt
```

The assets are written to `dist/v3.1.2/`; this keeps previous release checksums
and archives intact. The ZIP excludes VCS state, Python caches and earlier builds.

The published `v3.1.0` tag, its assets and its checksums stay exactly as they were
released; a fix after the tag ships as the next version, never as a replacement.

## Commit v3.1.2

For an existing checkout:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Release v3.1.2"
git push
```

Do not re-run `git init` for an already existing repository.

## GitHub Release

Create a new GitHub Release with:

```text
Tag:   v3.1.2
Title: Music Production Toolkit 3.1.2 — Setup Help, Model Advisor, Progress Bars
```

Use `RELEASE_NOTES_v3.1.2.md` as the release description and upload the four generated release assets (ZIP, both workflow JSON files, checksums).

`docs/REDDIT_POST_v3.0.1.md` is the previous announcement draft and shows the format
if you want to write a new one for this version. Post it only after the release
and Registry publication have succeeded. Preparing local assets does not create
a remote GitHub release or publish to the Registry.

The Git tag uses a leading `v`; the package/Registry version remains `3.1.2` without the leading `v`.

After committing and pushing the checked release tree above, the equivalent
GitHub CLI commands are:

```bash
git tag -a v3.1.2 -m "Release v3.1.2"
git push origin v3.1.2
gh release create v3.1.2 --verify-tag --title "Music Production Toolkit 3.1.2 — Setup Help, Model Advisor, Progress Bars" --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v3.1.2.md dist/v3.1.2/ComfyUI-MiniMax-Music-Production-Toolkit-v3.1.2.zip dist/v3.1.2/Music_Production_Toolkit_v3.1.2.json dist/v3.1.2/Music_Production_AudioEnhance_v3.1.2.json dist/v3.1.2/SHA256SUMS.txt
```

Run these only once for this new version. A successful local build alone does
not create the commit, tag or published release.

## Comfy Registry

The project is configured with:

```toml
[tool.comfy]
PublisherId = "jplenio"
DisplayName = "Music Production Toolkit"
```

Create a Registry Publishing API Key for the publisher and store it in GitHub:

**Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

Secret name:

```text
REGISTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

`.github/workflows/publish_action.yml` runs on a published GitHub Release or manually through **Actions → Publish to Comfy Registry → Run workflow**.

Registry versions are immutable. Never republish different contents under an already published version; bump the version instead.

## Manual Registry publish

If needed, use Comfy CLI from the repository root:

```bash
comfy node publish
```

## GitHub Pages audio demos

The repository includes `docs/index.html` for SoundCloud-backed listening examples.

Maintain the demo catalog in `docs/demo-tracks.js` (prefer `scripts/update_demo_catalog.py` for metadata imports), then enable Pages:

**Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**

- Source: `Deploy from a branch`
- Branch: `main`
- Folder: `/docs`

Expected URL:

https://jplenio.github.io/ComfyUI-MiniMax-Music-Production-Toolkit/

The demo HTML belongs in GitHub source control. Large MP3 catalogs should remain on SoundCloud rather than in Git history.
